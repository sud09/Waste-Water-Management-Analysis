#  Waste Water Management Analysis

## Overview 

The waste water management project aims to monitor and optimize the treatment and
disposal of wastewater in USA. The project involves multiple wastewater treatment
plants, sources of waste water across various locations. The main objective is to ensure
efficient treatment of wastewater

## Goal

-  Ensure efficient and responsible treatment of wastewater to improve effectiveness and efficiency.
-  Integrate data from different sources and performing analysis.
-  Design Analytical Report.
-  Provide Recommendations based on analytical report.

## Objective and Scope

**1. Data Collection and observation:** The project emphasis lies on collecting data
related to treatment Plants, sources of waste water, and treatment results. These metrics
are used for analyzing the overall performance of treatment facilities.

**2. Performance Analysis:** The project aims to evaluate the performance of different
treatment facilities. It seeks to identify areas of improvement, optimize treatment
efficiency, and enhance the overall effectiveness of wastewater management systems.

**3. Analysis of Waste Water Sources:** The project recognizes the importance of
understanding the sources of wastewater and their specific characteristics. It aims to
analyze wastewater based on different sources such as residential, healthcare, or
industrial to identify any specific treatment requirements.

## Learnings 

This project I worked on, taught me several things:

**1. Working with Pandas Library:**
-    Reading data from CSV files using `pd.read_csv()`
-    Checking information about the data using `df.info()`
-    Handling null values and duplicates using `df.isnull().sum()` and `df.duplicated().sum()`
-    Converting data types using `pd.to_datetime()` and method chaining
-    Deriving new columns from existing data
-    Merging/joining dataframes using `pd.merge()`
-    Grouping data and performing aggregations like `sum()`, `mean()`

**2. Data Visualization with Plotly**:
- Creating bar charts using `px.bar()`
- Creating pie/donut charts using `px.pie()`
- Customizing chart layouts, titles, axes, legends
- Sorting and filtering data for visualization
-  Creating line charts using `px.line()`

**3. Data Manipulation**:
- Sorting dataframes using `sort_values()`
- Applying functions like `round()` to columns
- Performing arithmetic operations on columns

**4. Calculating Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**:
- Calculating the volume of water treated by treatment plants
- Calculating the contribution of waste water from different sources
- Calculating the utilization of treatment plants based on capacity
- Calculating the efficiency of treatment plants based on successful treatment

**5. Working with Datetime**:
- Extracting day names from datetime objects using `dt.day_name()`
- Grouping and aggregating data based on dates


## Deliverables
**1. Data Consolidation and Transformation:** Consolidation of relevant data sources,
such as wastewater treatment plant data, sources of waste water data into a structured
format suitable for analysis.

**2. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):** Identify key performance indicators related to wastewater management.

**3. Analytical Report:** Creation analytical reports that provide insights into wastewater treatment performance. These visualizations are helpful in monitoring KPIs, identify trends, and to make data-driven decisions for process optimization.

**4. Recommendations:** Recommendations based on data analysis to optimize
wastewater treatment processes, minimize resource consumption, and enhance overall
efficiency

## Risk
**1. Data Quality and Availability:** The risk of incomplete, inaccurate, or inconsistent
data could impact the reliability and validity of the analytics outcomes. Inefficient data
collection procedures or data integration challenges could hamper project chances of
success.

**2. Protection of Data:** Dealing with confidential wastewater data requires rigorous data security measures. Inadequate data protection practices, unauthorized access, or data breaches could compromise the confidentiality and privacy of the data, leading to legal and reputational risks.

**3. Interpretation and Decision-making:** The interpretation of analytics results requires expertise and understanding of context. Misinterpretation of data, biases, or incorrect decision-making could lead to ineffective outcomes.

**4. Budget & Resource Constraints:** Insufficient resources, both financial and human,
could impact the project's scope, timeline, and quality
